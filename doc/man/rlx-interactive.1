.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Launch an interactive console with \fBrlx i\fR, interactive consoles may not be nested. Help is available via \fB?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR and \fBhelp\fR. If \fB\-\-no\-interactive\fR is specified it is ignored.

.SH "LOCATION"
.PP
Run the \fBcd\fR command to change the current location, inspect the location with \fBpwd\fR.
.PP
When \fBcd\fR is invoked with no arguments it clears the currently selected database, document and revision but keeps the current server, clear the currently selected server as well with \fBcd /\fR.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
Commands are not required in interactive mode, you may set any argument:

.SP
  \-\-http                    # enable http logging
.br
  \-\-no\-http                 # disable http logging
.br
  \-d {db}                   # set current database
.br
  \-d                        # clear current database
.br
  \-\-no\-color                # disable colors
.PP
To alleviate typing so many hyphens shortcuts are available. Provided a command is not specified in the interactive console you may also set options without the leading hyphens using the long name:

.SP
  no\-color                  # disable colors
.br
  color                     # enable colors
.br
  http log\-level debug      # enable http logging (debug)
.PP
The only current known collision is between the \fBhelp\fR command and \fB\-\-help\fR option, in this case \fBhelp\fR is preferred, you can still use \fB\-\-help\fR but no shortcut is available.
.SH "HISTORY INTERPRETER"
.PP
An experimental history command interpreter is enabled by default that recognizes index based references such as \fB!!\fR (or \fB!\-1\fR) and \fB!1\fR, 
.SH "FILES"
.PP
The history file is read and written from \fB~/.rlx/.history\fR, when this command is invoked the file (and parent directories) are created if they do not exist.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
