.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
To search documents specify regular expression(s) (and/or glob patterns) and one or more files. If input is specified on stdin, \-\-file or \-\-json if becomes the first in the list of documents to search. You can specify more files to search but they must have a \fB.json\fR file extension.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBgrep, re\fR: Find objects matching a pattern.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4

.SH "PATTERNS"
.PP
By default regular expression  patterns only search keys, add the \fB\-\-values\fR option to also search values. You may search values only by negating the key pattern match: \fB\-\-no\-keys \-\-values\fR.
.PP
Glob patterns match on the object keys joined on a forward slash, they never match against values.
.PP
When combining patterns with \fB\-g | \-\-glob\fR the matches are combined.
.PP
Patterns are specified using typical regular expression notation:

  cat package.json | rlx j re \- '/cli\-.*/'
