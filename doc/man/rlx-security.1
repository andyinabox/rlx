.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBsecurity\fR commands modify the security document for a database. The \fBrm\fR subcommand is a slight misnomer as the document is not actually removed, it is shorthand for setting the security document to the empty object (\fB{}\fR) which removes all database level security.
.PP
The \fBrm\fR subcommand name was chosen for consistency with other subcommands and is more concise than \fBreset\fR.
