.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These commands operate on two types of template, \fBfile templates\fR that correspond to a single file and may be parsed to produce a JSON document using variables declared on the command line and \fBapplication templates\fR which are directories that are collated to a design document.
.PP
To refer to a file template just specify the relative path, eg: \fBuser/new\fR, to reference an application prefix the template name with \fBdesign/\fR, eg: \fBdesign/minimal\fR.
.PP
Templates may be referenced using the \fB\-t | \-\-template\fR option (or the first additional argument), the value may be a file system path or short reference, eg: \fBuser/new\fR. Short references are relative to the template directory and may or may not include the file extension.
.PP
By default templates are resolved by first searching the user template directory and then the system template directory. You can modify these search paths with \fB\-\-[no]\-system\fR, \fB\-\-[no]\-user\fR and \fB\-\-search\-path=[dir...]\fR options, see \fBFILES\fR for more information.
.PP
If no subcommand is specified \fBls\fR is invoked.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBinit\fR: Copy templates.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBls\fR: List template files.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBprint\fR: Print template.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBparse\fR: Parse template and print result.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBdir\fR: Print template search path.
.EL
.SH "OPTIONS"
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-\-[no]\-system\fR: Include system templates.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-\-[no]\-user\fR: Include user templates (overrides \-\-system).
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-\-search\-path=[dir...]\fR: Prepend template directories to the search path.
.EL
.SH "INIT"
.PP
The \fBinit\fR command when called with no arguments will attempt to copy all system templates to the user template directory. When a template is specified and no output directory is specified the template is copied to the current working directory.
.PP
To import a particular template from the system directory to the user directory specify the output directory:

  rlx tpl init design/minimal ~/.rlx/template
.PP
If the destination already exists an error is reported unless the \fB\-\-force\fR option has been specified.
.PP
When copying application templates, the \fBdesign\fR directory is included in the destination, this is intentional and allows for applications that have multiple design documents.
.PP
You can change the name of the destination template with an additional \fB<name>\fR argument.
.SH "LIST"
.PP
The \fBls\fR command may be used to list all template files as JSON, use the \fB\-\-raw\fR option to print a tree hierarchy of the template files, you may filter the list using the \fB\-g | \-\-glob\fR option.
.PP
Empty directories and hidden files (those starting with a period '.') are not included in the list.
.SH "PRINT"
.PP
When using the \fBprint\fR command on file templates the contents of the template file are printed, when used on application templates a design document is collated from the directory contents and printed.
.PP
The \fBprint\fR and \fBparse\fR commands behave the same on application templates (they print the collated document) except \fBparse\fR will include additional information such as an attachment file list.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
Variables only apply to file templates for application templates they will be ignored.
.PP
Variables are declared with an \fB@\fR symbol and must include an assignment operator (\fB=\fR). For example, \fB@foo=bar\fR will set the template variable named \fBfoo\fR to the string \fBbar\fR.
.PP
Template values are coerced to their native types and it is possible to create an array by using a comma delimiter, eg: \fB@foo=bar,baz\fR.
.PP
Templates must export a function. Functions are invoked asynchronously and are passed the request object and a callback function:

.SP
module.exports = function template(req, cb){
.br
  return cb(null, {});
.br
}
.PP
They are invoked in the scope of the parsed variables object so if the template was parsed with \fB@id=foo\fR and looked like:

.SP
module.exports = function template(req, cb){
.br
  var doc = {
.br
    _id: this.id
.br
  }
.br
  return cb(null, doc);
.br
}
.PP
The result would be a JSON document such as:

.SP
{
.br
  "_id": "foo"
.br
}
.SH "FILES"
.PP
Files are read by default first from \fB~/.rlx/template\fR (user templates) and then from the templates bundled with the program \fBlib/template\fR (system templates).
.PP
If a \fBrc\fR file declares an array of search paths (\fBsearch.paths.template\fR) these are prepended to the list of search paths, if \fB\-\-search\-path\fR has been specified the values are prepended to the search path.
.PP
So the precedence is:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
cli (\fB\-\-search\-path\fR)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
rc file configuration
.IP "\[ci]" 4
user templates
.IP "\[ci]" 4
system templates
.EL
.PP
When using \fB\-\-[no]\-user\fR and \fB\-\-[no]\-system\fR cli search paths and rc search paths are still included.
.PP
Application templates are read from the \fBdesign\fR sub\-directory.
